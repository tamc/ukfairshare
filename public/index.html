    <h1>The UK's 'every person is equal' share of greenhouse gas emissions</h1>
    <p>We can only emit a finite quanitity of greenhouse gases and restrain climate change to two degrees. This finite quantity needs to be divided between countries. One approach to this division is to give people an equal share, irrespective of their country. One question is how much of history should be included in that definition: should we be responsible for emissions from today? from when we agreed to tackle climate change? from when we discovered climate change was happening? from when we started emitting? This calculator allows the consequence of the different amount of histroy on what constitutes the UK's fair share to be explored. The range of colours show the range of uncertainty about population and about what the limit on emissions before two degrees happens is. The yellow band is 'central' in terms of both population and climate change.</p>
