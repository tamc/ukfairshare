# Electricity Build Rate constraint

This is a quick attempt. It is probably both wrong and buggy, so don't trust it yet.

The purpose of this application is to help people to explore what would happen to electricity generation emissions in the UK out to 2050 under a variety of different assumptions. It is based around a very simple excel model.

Report bugs to <https://github.com/decc/electricity-build-rate-constraint/issues>

## Dependencies

1. Ruby 2.0
2. A working C compiler
3. A webserver configured to run rack

To configure a webserver on OSX (done after setup below)

    gem install powder
    powder install
    cd /directory_where_this_program_is_installed
    powder link
    powder open
  
The resulting website only works properly on the latest generation of browsers.

Only tested on OSX 10.8.3 so far.

## Setup

    bundle
    bundle exec ruby make-model.rb

## Hacking

Written in a combination of Ruby and Coffeescript. 

    electricity-build-rate-constraint.xlsx - The actual model of the electricity system that we are exploring
    model.c - An computer-generated translation of the excel file into C
    model.rb - A ruby interface to model.c
    config.ru and server.rb - Serves 
      the data from model.rb
      public/index.html
      the javascripts refered to in src/javascripts/application.js
      the stylesheets refered to in src/stylesheets/application.css
    chart.js.coffee - The main program at the moment.

Fixes accepted, preferably using 'Fork&Pull' on github: <http://gun.io/blog/how-to-github-fork-branch-and-pull-request/>

## The parallel demo

This is a bit experimental.

Steps: 

    bundle exec ruby montecarlo.rb > public/runs.csv
    powder open
    go to /parallel.html in your browser
